   <p> “With so many disparate web technologies and standards,   organisations need a unifying platform that can be configured to   integrate complex business processes.”</p>
    <p>Squiz Matrix is the   ultimate web Business Integration Engine which can be configured to   accommodate an organisations web integration requirements today and into   the future. It features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Industry standard protocols such as REST, SOAP, JSON and PEAR.</li>
      <li>Content Aggregation of external sites using remote content and RSS syndication</li>
      <li>Support for Social Networking like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and WordPress</li>
      <li>Open API with high degree of customisation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Squiz   Matrix delivers highly flexible and robust business integration and   application development tools to provide an effective web experience   platform. It is based on the very successful MySource Matrix which had   evolved into a powerful platform that is well beyond the functionality   offered by a CMS. Squiz Matrix features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Web Services API with high degree of customisation</li>
      <li>Configurable application logic and technical interface</li>
      <li>Flexible platform setup options (virtual, physical, cloud)</li>
      <li>A content hub offering portal functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Squiz   will configure your Squiz Matrix system via our implementation services   unless you have the advanced technical resources to operate the   administration interface. Most users will simply edit content via the   Squiz CMS interface.</p>
    <h2><strong>3rd Party Applications</strong></h2>
    <p>Squiz   Matrix uses industry standard cross-platform protocols such as REST,   SOAP, JSON and PEAR provide flexible connectivity between Squiz Matrix   and 3rd Party systems. Content can be sent, retrieved and   modified on the other system from within Squiz Matrix. Other systems can   also use web services to “push” information into Squiz Matrix. For   example, the Squiz HP TRIM and SharePoint bridges are based on the SOAP   protocol.</p>
    <h2><strong>Content Aggregation</strong></h2>
    <p>Squiz Matrix can   effectively extract content from a remote site, strip away the original   design and display it seamlessly within the design of your site as   nested content. Start and end tags can be defined to specify that   content between the tags on the remote page will be discarded. Inbound   information can also be syndicated via the RSS Data Source which   connects to any valid RSS feed and show the item as shadow assets within   the Squiz Matrix system. The item is displayed using an asset listing   to list the RSS items in the feed.</p>
    <h2><strong>Data Repositories</strong></h2>
    <p>The   Squiz DB Data Source can connect to PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL and Oracle   client databases and show the contents as shadow assets within Squiz   Matrix. The Data Source Graph tool creates a dynamic graph of the   results from a DB Data Source asset. Besides graphing, you can also   list/sort/group using an Asset Listing, write back to the DB if you   want, or lock it down to only read data. Write your own SQL query to   retrieve required information or use an existing one.</p>
    <h2><strong>Social Networking Tools</strong></h2>
    <p>Names   like Facebook and YouTube are now part of everyday dialogue and   organisations now have relatively inexpensive and accessible ways to   reach consumers through the Internet. Squiz Matrix can effectively   address your social media business needs with support for Google Maps,   Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Slideshare, WordPress etc. and the   capability to connect with tomorrow’s technologies.</p>
